# Tan Li Shuen - Data Projects

## About

Hello, I'm Li Shuen, the owner of this repository. A little background on myself, I am currently a Data Analyst in Speedhome since December 2021. Before I've embarked on my career, I was majoring in Data Analytics and I am currently holding a Bachelor of Information Systems (Honours) (Data Analytics) degree.

<br>
This is a repository where I'd share my projects and monitor my development in areas connected to data analytics and data science.
