## About

Hello, I'm Li Shuen, the owner of this repository. A little background on myself, I am currently a Data Analyst in Speedhome since December 2021. Before I've embarked on my career, I was majoring in Data Analytics and I am currently holding a Bachelor of Information Systems (Honours) (Data Analytics) degree.

This is a repository where I'd share my projects and monitor my development in areas connected to data analytics and data science.

##### Introduction

This repository stores the data files of Maven Market’s sales transactions data, product return data and multiple lookup data files with information on the customers, products, calendar, stores and regions. These data sets are obtained from an online course on Udemy named Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence and were a bonus project provided by the creators of the course.
