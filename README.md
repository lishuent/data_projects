# Data Projects

## About

Hello, I'm Li Shuen, the owner of this repository. A little background on myself, I am currently a Data Analyst in Speedhome since December 2021. Before I've embarked on my career, I was majoring in Data Analytics and I am currently holding a Bachelor of Information Systems (Honours) (Data Analytics) degree.

<br>
This is a repository where I'd share my projects and monitor my development in areas connected to data analytics and data science.

### Data Visualization
#### MavenMarket
##### Introduction

This repository stores the data files of Maven Market’s sales transactions data, product return data and multiple lookup data files with information on the customers, products, calendar, stores and regions. These data sets are obtained from an online course on Udemy named Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence and were a bonus project provided by the creators of the course.

##### Introduction of the Data Set
Maven Market is a multi-national grocery chain located in Canada, Mexico and the United States. In this Power BI report, I have focused on building a dashboard that:
* Highlights key metrics on product sales, profit and region to provide a top-level overview of the business’s performance
* Helps the business to get a better understanding of their consumers based on their demographics
* Enables the business to evaluate the amount of impact on sales and profit based on the changes in the product sales price (such as product discounts)

Below are the snapshots of the Power BI report (separated by pages)

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Netflix EDA
##### Introduction

This repository stores the Jupyter Notebook file on the exploratory data analysis I’ve performed on a Netflix data set downloaded from Kaggle.

##### Introduction of the Data Set
Netflix is a streaming service that provides a huge selection of TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries and more. This data set includes all of the shows available on Netflix (under the United States region) and it was acquired in July 2022. 

The dataset is named titles (titles.csv) and it contains over 5000 unique titles on Netflix along with their information. The description of the columns provided in this dataset is written in the Notebook file. In this Jupyter Notebook file (named Netflix_EDA.ipynb), I explored the dataset and performed various data-cleaning steps. After that, I focused on extracting insights that would answer the questions below:
* How many % of the shows on Netflix are movies and tv shows?
* What are the most produced and most popular age-certificated titles?
* What are the top genres and production countries of the titles on Netflix?
* How long do TV shows tend to go on before getting cancelled?
* Are there any correlations between the variables existing in the dataset?
